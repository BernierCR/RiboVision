First commit of Public Version 1.02

This isn't totally ready yet. The documentation isn't in here, yet. The code isn't organized and commented enough. 
I don't have all the licenses in here correct. I still need to describe the backend archetecture. 

This is the first time I ever actually released any of my source code. 

The parts that are mine, most of it, are licensed under the MIT license. Other people's libraries will get their licenses and copyrights listed soon. 
They are already there if in their respective files. 

We welcome code (and data) contributions from the community. We are still getting organized, but please contact us.
